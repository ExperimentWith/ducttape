/**
 * All incoming metaedges to a vertex will be assigned exactly one of their member hyperedges.
 * This is represented by the sequence "edges". The parentRealizations are actually parallel
 * with the number of incoming metaedges for a vertex. The next sequence is parallel with the
 * number of edges in the active hyperedge for our current path (the one in this unpacking).
 * TODO: Document an example of how to iterate over this easily with zip()
 *
 * Like UnpackedVertex, this interface explicitly avoids giving unpacked vertices as
 * parents so that we can eventually discard more of the explored space
 * the prevState can store information such as "what realizations does my parent have?"
 * NOTE: It's actually the incoming edges that are meta -- not the vertex itself
 * 
 * parentRealizations is parallel (i.e. has the same array length) with "edges", which is
 *   the hyperedges associated with this metaedge
 *   the second layer of sequences is parallel with the plain edges inside each hyperedge (Seq[Seq[D]]).
 *   the inner-most sequence represents a realization (Seq[D]).
 *
 * The incoming hyperedges for this UnpackedMetaVertex (edges) are parallel with the the outer-most
 * sequence of parentRealizations. This allows us to access each parent vertex's active realization
 * using the following pattern:
 *   val v: UnpackedMetaVertex = ...
 *   v.edges.zip(v.parentRealizations).foreach { case (hyperedgeElements: HyperEdge[H,E], parentReals: Seq[Seq[D]]) =>
 *     hyperedgeElements.zip(parentReals).foreach { case (e, parentReal) =>
 *       System.out.println("Parent realization of edge " + e + "is " + parentReal)
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * For readability, you could mentally typedef:
 * type Realization = Seq[D]
 * type HyperEdgeParentRealizations = Seq[Realization]
 * type MetaEdgeParentRealizations = Seq[Seq[Realization]]
 *
 * dual: The "dualistic" representation of this meta vertex in underlying HyperDag (not MetaHyperDag)
 *       used to represent this MetaHyperDag.
 *
 * see [[ducttape.hyperdag.meta.MetaHyperDag]] for definitions of generic types
