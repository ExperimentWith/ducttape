/**
 * In a MetaHyperDag, all vertices have only MetaEdges as their only incoming "edges".
 * In drawn notation, meta edges are typically drawn as thick arrows with thin
 * incoming hyperdges. In GraphViz, we represent a MetaEdge as an "epsilon" vertex
 * in the AND-OR representation of a MetaHyperDag.
 * 
 * A derivation (beginning from some vertex) consists of each input MetaEdge having
 * exactly one input HyperEdge assigned to it. Unlike a HyperDag, in which
 * only one HyperEdge per vertex can be active in a single derivation,
 * a MetaHyperDag requires that *all* input MetaEdges be active for each
 * vertex.
 *
 * see [[ducttape.hyperdag.meta.MetaHyperDag]] for definitions of generic types
