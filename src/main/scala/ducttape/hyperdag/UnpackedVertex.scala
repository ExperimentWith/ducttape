/**
 * An UnpackedVertex is returned by a walker while traversing and
 * unpacking a HyperDAG.
 * 
 * Note: this interface explicitly avoids giving unpacked vertices as
 * parents so that we cabn eventually discard more of the explored space
 * the prevState can store information such as "what realizations does my parent have?"
 *
 * @param parentRealizations The realizations for each parent of this vertex.
 *                           The ordering of the parent realizations is parallel with the 
 *                           ordering returned by [[HyperDag.parents()]]
 *
 * see [[ducttape.hyperdag.HyperDag]] for definitions of generic types V, H, E
 * see [[ducttape.hyperdag.walker.UnpackedDagWalker]] for definition of generic type D
